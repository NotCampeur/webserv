## [The Norm](.readme/norm.md)  

### :zzz: TODO :zzz:  
*  Comment each methods  
*  Config file options and parsing
*  Requests handling
*  Timeout checks
### :boom: Known bugs.. I mean features :boom:  
* Getting "Relais brisÃ© (pipe)" error sometimes when trying to read clients' requests.
* Valrgind throwing errors following SIGINT: seems to come from poll, as poll gets interupted by SIGINT (signal handler seems to be reset during poll call)

## :writing_hand: Change log :writing_hand:  
* The headers' protection have been standardize.  
* Sources directories restructuring.
