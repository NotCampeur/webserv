## [The Norm](.readme/norm.md)  

### :zzz: TODO :zzz:  
*  Comment each methods  
*  Standardize the headers' protection.  
*  Update setsockopt to be able to reuse sockets after program quits  
### :boom: Known bugs.. I mean features :boom:  
* Getting "Relais brisÃ© (pipe)" error sometimes when trying to read clients' requests.
* Valrgind throwing errors following SIGINT: seems to come from poll, as poll gets interupted by SIGINT (signal handler seems to be reset during poll call)
* Server crash if restarted before socket becomes available again

## :writing_hand: Change log :writing_hand:  
* Logger class improved and commented.
