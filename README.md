## [The Norm](.readme/norm.md)  

### :zzz: TODO :zzz:
*  Parsing of Hexadecimal values in URL -> in validator class
*  Comment each methods  
*  Need to manage the route in the config

### :boom: Known bugs.. I mean features :boom:  
* Getting "Relais brisÃ© (pipe)" error sometimes when trying to read clients' requests.
* Valrgind throwing errors following SIGINT: seems to come from poll, as poll gets interupted by SIGINT (signal handler seems to be reset during poll call)
* When you try to get a file inside a file you get a 500 error. -> "[Tue Aug  3 20:03:05 2021] {ERROR} Error on stat call: Not a directory : 192.168.0.139"
## :writing_hand: Change log :writing_hand:  
* The headers' protection have been standardize.  
* Sources directories restructuring.  
* Fixed a SystemException bug, the class was not a correct derived class of std::exception.
